AuthSamples.VirtualScheme.PathSchemeSelection
=================

Sample demonstrating selecting between cookie and another authentication scheme based on the request:

Cookie flow is the same, but notice in Startup how the "Request" virtual scheme is now the default scheme
1. Run the app and click on the MyClaims tab, this should trigger a redirect to login.
2. Login with any username and password, the sample just validates that any values are provided.
3. You should be redirected back to /Home/MyClaims which will output a few user claims from the cookie
4. Now try going to /api/Home/MyClaims which will output a different set of claims (from the Api scheme)

Startup.cs is the most interesting class in the sample.
